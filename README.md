# Credit Union Analysis

## Introduction
This project explores key metrics of credit unions using correlation analysis and visualizations. The dataset includes information on total assets, loans, deposits, members, and growth rates over four quarters.

## Methodology
We performed data cleaning, calculated correlation matrices, and visualized the results using heatmaps and other charts.

## Data Source
The data was sourced from the [NCUA website](https://www.ncua.gov/files/publications/analysis/federally-insured-credit-union-list-march-2024.zip).

## Results
The correlation matrix heatmap reveals several strong relationships, such as between Total Assets and Total Loans, and between Members and Total Deposits.

## Conclusion
This analysis highlights significant correlations between key credit union metrics. These insights provide a preliminary basis and can inform further analysis and decision-making processes. Further analysis would include more detailed data sets on specific credit unions in "top 5" peer groups as indicated in this anlaysis.
